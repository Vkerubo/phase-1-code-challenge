Title: Speeding Ticket Program

This is a simple program that takes as input the speed of a car and determines if the driver should be given a demerit point for speeding.

Getting Started:
To use the program, simply run the JavaScript file and enter the speed of the car when prompted. The program will then determine if the driver should be given a demerit point for speeding, based on the following rules:

>If the speed is less than 70 km/s, the program will print "Ok".
>If the speed is 70 km/s or more, the program will give the driver one demerit point for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), and print the total number of demerit points.
>If the driver gets more than 12 demerit points, the program will print "License suspended".

Usage:
>Open the JavaScript file in a code editor of your choice.
>Run the program using a JavaScript runtime environment, such as Node.js.
>Enter the speed of the car when prompted.
>The program will determine if the driver should be given a demerit point and print the appropriate message.
